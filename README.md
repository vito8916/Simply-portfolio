## Basic structure

A basic HTML5 Boilerplate site initially looks something like this:

```
.
├── css
│   ├── main.css
│   └── normalize.css
│   └── styles.css
├── img
│   └── icons/
├── js
│   ├── main.js
├── 404.html
├── browserconfig.xml
├── favicon.ico
├── humans.txt
├── icon.png
├── index.html
├── package.json
├── robots.txt
├── tile.png
└── tile-wide.png
```

### css

This directory contains all CSS files necessary to style this project, define the layout, theme color, and fonts. 

### js

This directory contains the main.js file where the main interactions scripts are located. 

###img

This directory contains all images and thumbnails of our projects. 

### 404.html

A simple but helpful custom 404.

### index.html

This is the default HTML skeleton.

### browserconfig.xml

This file contains all settings regarding custom tiles for IE11 and Edge.
(This will no longer be necessary in the future)

### humans.txt

Edit this file to include the team that worked on your simply personal portfolio, and the
technology powering it.

### package.json

Edit this file to describe your application, add dependencies, scripts and
other properties related to node based development and the npm registry

### robots.txt

Edit this file to include any pages you need hidden from search engines.

### Icons

Replace the default `favicon.ico`, `tile.png`, `tile-wide.png` and Apple Touch
Icon with your own. I personally use: https://realfavicongenerator.net/ to generate favicon easily
